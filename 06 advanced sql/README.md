# Advanced SQL Features

Welcome to the **Advanced SQL Features** section of the DBMS Interview Preparation Hub. This folder explores powerful SQL capabilities that go beyond basic queryingâ€”allowing you to perform complex analyses, automate data operations, and manage transaction logic.

You will learn about:

* **Window Functions**
* **Common Table Expressions (CTEs) & Recursive Queries**
* **Triggers, Stored Procedures & Functions**
* **Cursors & Transactions**

---

## 1. Window Functions

### 1.1 Concept

* **Definition**: Functions that perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row, without collapsing them into a single output row (unlike aggregates).
* **Use Cases**: Ranking, running totals, moving averages, percentiles.

### 1.2 Syntax Structure

```sql
FUNCTION() OVER (
  [PARTITION BY partition_expression]
  [ORDER BY order_expression]
  [frame_clause]
)
```

### 1.3 Common Examples

* **ROW\_NUMBER()**: Assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition.

```sql
SELECT emp_id, dept_id,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rn
FROM Employee;
```

* **RANK(), DENSE\_RANK()**: Ranking functions that handle ties differently.

* **SUM(), AVG()** running totals:

```sql
SELECT order_date,
  SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
FROM Orders;
```

## 2. CTEs (WITH) & Recursive Queries

### 2.1 CTEs

* **Definition**: Temporary named result sets defined within a `WITH` clause, improving readability and modularity.
* **Syntax**:

```sql
WITH cte_name (col1, col2, ...) AS (
  SELECT ...
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

* **Use Case**: Breaking complex queries into logical steps.

### 2.2 Recursive CTEs

* **Definition**: CTEs that refer to themselves to perform hierarchical or iterative queries.

* **Structure**:

  1. **Anchor member**: Base result set.
  2. **Recursive member**: References the CTE name.

* **Syntax**:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte_name AS (
  -- Anchor
  SELECT ...
  UNION ALL
  -- Recursive step
  SELECT ... FROM cte_name JOIN ...
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

* **Example**: Employee managerial hierarchy.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE OrgChart(emp_id, manager_id, level) AS (
  SELECT emp_id, manager_id, 1 AS level
  FROM Employee
  WHERE manager_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT e.emp_id, e.manager_id, oc.level + 1
  FROM Employee e
  JOIN OrgChart oc ON e.manager_id = oc.emp_id
)
SELECT * FROM OrgChart;
```

---

## 3. Triggers, Stored Procedures & Functions

### 3.1 Triggers

* **Definition**: Automatically executed code in response to specified table events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
* **Use Cases**: Auditing, validation, cascading updates.
* **Syntax**:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
  {BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}
  ON table_name
  FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  -- procedural code (SQL or PL/pgSQL)
END;
```

### 3.2 Stored Procedures

* **Definition**: Named, parameterized sets of statements stored in the database and invoked explicitly.
* **Features**: Control-of-flow statements, transaction control.
* **Syntax (MySQL example)**:

```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE increase_salaries(p_dept INT, p_pct DECIMAL)
BEGIN
  UPDATE Employee
  SET salary = salary * (1 + p_pct)
  WHERE dept_id = p_dept;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```

### 3.3 Functions

* **Definition**: Similar to procedures but return a single value and can be used in SQL expressions.
* **Example (PostgreSQL)**:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION calculate_tax(amount DECIMAL) RETURNS DECIMAL AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN amount * 0.1;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## 4. Cursors & Transactions

### 4.1 Cursors

* **Definition**: Database objects that allow row-by-row processing of query results.
* **Use Cases**: Complex business logic, row-level operations not achievable in set-based SQL.
* **Syntax (PL/pgSQL)**:

```sql
DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR SELECT emp_id, salary FROM Employee;
OPEN cur;
FETCH NEXT FROM cur INTO v_emp, v_sal;
-- loop and process
CLOSE cur;
```

### 4.2 Transactions

* **Definition**: Logical units of work that must be entirely committed or rolled back to maintain data integrity.
* **ACID Properties**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
* **Control**:

  * `BEGIN` or `START TRANSACTION`
  * `COMMIT` to save changes
  * `ROLLBACK` to undo
* **Example**:

```sql
BEGIN;
  UPDATE Account SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
  UPDATE Account SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
  COMMIT;
```
